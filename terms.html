      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="sub">Last updated: <strong>YYYY-MM-DD</strong></p>

      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Veil</strong> (the “Service”), a Discord bot operated by <strong>YOUR_COMPANY_NAME</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”).
        By using Veil, you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
      </p>

      <h2>1) Eligibility & Acceptance</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your country) and comply with
        <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord’s Terms</a>.
        Installing or using the bot in a server constitutes acceptance of these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>2) Bot Use & Conduct</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You’re responsible for any content posted via Veil in your server.</li>
        <li>Do not use the Service for illegal activities, harassment, hate, doxxing, or content that violates Discord policies or server rules.</li>
        <li>We may limit or disable features, or remove access, to protect users or comply with law/policy.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) Virtual Currency & Subscriptions</h2>
      <p><strong>Veil Coins.</strong> Veil offers virtual currency (“Coins”) sold in packs and/or refilled monthly based on your server tier. Coins have no real-world value, are non-transferable, and are only usable within Veil.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Purchases.</strong> Payments are processed by Stripe. You authorize us (and our processor) to charge your selected payment method.</li>
        <li><strong>Delivery.</strong> Coin packs typically apply instantly; server tiers unlock features and monthly refills.</li>
        <li><strong>No Cash Value.</strong> Coins are not redeemable for cash or equivalents.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-Refundable.</strong> Except where required by law, all purchases are final. See “Refunds” below.</li>
        <li><strong>Fraud/Chargebacks.</strong> We may revoke Coins, downgrade tiers, or suspend access if fraud, abuse, or chargebacks occur.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4) Tiers, Billing & Cancellation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Recurring Billing.</strong> Paid tiers (e.g., Basic, Premium, Elite) auto-renew until canceled.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellation.</strong> Server admins can cancel any time. Access continues until the end of the current billing period; then the server reverts to Free.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Failures.</strong> We may suspend or downgrade service if payment fails.</li>
        <li><strong>Price/Feature Changes.</strong> We may adjust pricing or features; we’ll post updates here and/or in-app where practical.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5) Refunds</h2>
      <p>
        Except where required by applicable law, purchases are non-refundable. If you believe there’s a billing error,
        contact us within 7 days at <a href="mailto:YOUR_SUPPORT_EMAIL">YOUR_SUPPORT_EMAIL</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>6) Content & IP</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You keep rights to your content; you grant us a limited license to process and display it to operate the Service.</li>
        <li>You represent that your content doesn’t infringe others’ rights or applicable laws.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7) Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        See our <a href="https://YOUR_DOMAIN/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Privacy Policy</a> for how we handle data.
        By using Veil, you consent to those practices.
      </p>

      <h2>8) Disclaimers</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW,
        WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
        AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE SERVICE.
      </p>

      <h2>9) Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
        EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE
        OF THE SERVICE. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US IN THE 3 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.
      </p>

      <h2>10) Termination</h2>
      <p>
        You may remove the bot at any time. We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms or we believe
        it’s necessary for safety, security, or legal reasons.
      </p>

      <h2>11) Changes to These Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. We’ll update the “Last updated” date and may provide in-app notice.
        Your continued use after changes means you accept the revised Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>12) Governing Law</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of <strong>YOUR_STATE_OR_COUNTRY</strong>, excluding its conflicts of law rules.
        Venue and jurisdiction will be in the courts located in <strong>YOUR_CITY/STATE</strong>, unless applicable law requires otherwise.
      </p>
