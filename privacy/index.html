      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="sub">Last updated: <strong>2025-08-09</strong></p>

      <p>
        This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Veil</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information
        when you use the Veil Discord bot and related websites at <a href="https://veilbot.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener">veilbot.dev</a>.
        By using Veil, you agree to this policy.
      </p>

      <h2>1) What We Collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Discord identifiers:</strong> user IDs, usernames, server (guild) IDs, channel IDs, message IDs, and role/permission flags needed to run the bot.</li>
        <li><strong>Veil activity:</strong> submitted Veil messages, unveil guesses (and correctness), leaderboard counts, coin balances and refills, and your server’s chosen configuration (e.g., linked channels, admin logs).</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription & purchases:</strong> tier, status, renewal dates, Stripe session/subscription IDs, and coin pack quantities. <em>We do not receive or store full card numbers.</em></li>
        <li><strong>Diagnostics & security:</strong> error logs, basic event logs, and metadata (timestamps, IPs from our hosting provider) for abuse prevention and uptime.</li>
        <li><strong>Website data:</strong> our site is static; we do not set tracking cookies. Hosting providers may collect standard server logs.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>2) How We Use Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Operate core features (anonymous posting, unveiling, coins, leaderboards, admin logging for eligible tiers).</li>
        <li>Process payments and manage subscriptions/coin grants (via Stripe).</li>
        <li>Prevent abuse, enforce limits, and keep the service reliable and secure.</li>
        <li>Comply with legal requirements and respond to lawful requests.</li>
        <li>Improve the Service (e.g., debugging, aggregate analytics from logs).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3) Payment Processing</h2>
      <p>
        We use <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe</a> to process payments. Stripe handles card data;
        we receive purchase metadata (e.g., price ID, coin amount, subscription ID) to fulfill your order. We do not store full payment card details.
      </p>

      <h2>4) Sharing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> hosting, databases, and payment processing (e.g., Stripe). They act on our instructions under appropriate safeguards.</li>
        <li><strong>Discord:</strong> interactions happen on Discord’s platform and are subject to
          <a href="https://discord.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord’s Privacy Policy</a>.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Legal/safety:</strong> we may disclose information if required by law or to protect users, our Service, or others.</li>
        <li><strong>No selling of personal data:</strong> we do not sell your personal information.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5) Data Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Operational records (IDs, coin balances, unveil stats) are kept while your server uses Veil and for a reasonable period after removal—for auditing, chargeback, and abuse-prevention.</li>
        <li>Error/security logs are kept for short, rotating periods unless needed longer to investigate issues.</li>
        <li>You can request deletion (see “Your Rights”). Some records may be retained where required by law or for legitimate business needs (e.g., fraud prevention).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6) Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data. No system is 100% secure, and transmission over the internet involves risk.
      </p>

      <h2>7) Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, export, or delete your information, or to object/restrict certain processing.
        Server administrators may manage server-level data (e.g., unlink channels, configure logs). For requests, email
        <a href="mailto:support@veilbot.dev">support@veilbot.dev</a> with your Discord user ID and the server ID(s) involved.
      </p>

      <h2>8) International Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Data may be processed in the United States or other countries where our providers operate. We take steps to ensure transfers are protected in accordance with applicable law.
      </p>

      <h2>9) Children</h2>
      <p>
        Veil is for users who meet <a href="https://discord.com/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord’s minimum age</a> (generally 13+).
        We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under applicable age thresholds.
      </p>

      <h2>10) Server Admin Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Admin log channels (Elite) may receive message copies and metadata for moderation/audit within your server.</li>
        <li>Anonymous posting in Veil is scoped to Discord—server moderators may still correlate activity through server tools and rules.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>11) Third-Party Links</h2>
      <p>
        Our site/bot may link to third-party services. Their privacy practices are their own; review those policies.
      </p>

      <h2>12) Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We’ll update the “Last updated” date and may provide in-app notice.
        Your continued use means you accept the changes.
      </p>

      <h2>13) Contact</h2>
      <p>
        Questions or requests? Email <a href="mailto:support@veilbot.dev">support@veilbot.dev</a>.
